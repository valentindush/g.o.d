            Girls Of Destiny is a family that grew up in the mind of a boy due to the trauma of not having a sibling to the point where he was put out and people saw it.

            <p>Helping me I found one of the happiest things on both sides. the side that gave it, and the side that was given to it, when you take a gift of clothing, or give it to a friend and give it to your friend tomorrow morning, you see that he is wearing it for your pleasure, And you are also given happiness. God does not believe in what we have but in what we do for others. No matter how much I live in rent, I want to do something that will make people laugh instead of shouting.</p>
